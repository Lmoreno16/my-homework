# My Thoughts
I am feeling tired and relieved now that I am understanding how to use git and the command line more easily. I was very frustrated a little bit earlier and almost gave up.
# Academic Career
I feel that has been a very long and tough journey for me and sometimes not sure if I should have quit a while ago, but I guess I don't know when to quit
