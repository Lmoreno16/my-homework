# My Thoughts
I am feeling tired and relieved now that I am understanding how to use git and the command line more easily. I was very frustrated a little bit earlier and almost gave up.
# Academic Career
I feel that has been a very long and tough journey for me and sometimes not sure if I should have quit a while ago, but I guess I don't know when to quit
# Favorite Movie
My favorite movie has to be a toss up between La La Land and The Wolf of Wallstreet. Both feel like they had a lot of impact on my life with friendships and relaionships. I love La La Land for the music, cinematogrophy, how much I felt I could relate to the main characters. The Wolf is the best comedy/drama I've ever seen. The debauchery, the messages, I just love the hell out of it.
