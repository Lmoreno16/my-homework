# My Thoughts
I am feeling tired and relieved now that I am understanding how to use git and the command line more easily. I was very frustrated a little bit earlier and almost gave up.
# Academic Career
I feel that has been a very long and tough journey for me and sometimes not sure if I should have quit a while ago, but I guess I don't know when to quit
# Favorite Movie
My favorite movie has to be a toss up between La La Land and The Wolf of Wallstreet. Both feel like they had a lot of impact on my life with friendships and relaionships. I love La La Land for the music, cinematogrophy, how much I felt I could relate to the main characters. The Wolf is the best comedy/drama I've ever seen. The debauchery, the messages, I just love the hell out of it.
# Favorite Videogame Genre
I absolutely love the fighting games. They are so much to me. The games I've played since my childhood with Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64. And then getting into the crazy crossover that was Marvel vs Capcom. My god. Venom, Megaman, Ryu, Wolverine... and some dude that took his clothes off and punched with his giant mecha. The absoulute coolest!
